GUI_Project
===========

This Project intends to Implement the Black-Litterman Model on various Stock Indices. It will eventually, incorporate propietary algorithms for generating views as well as their associated uncertainty's. It will test the algorithms over time for how they compare in comparison with the Market Portfolio. It also implements Standard Markowitz MVO and Single-factor MVO for further analysis.

The end product will be a GUI where the user can choose an investment horizon, risk tolerance, and Stock exchange. The algorithms will then be run to modify the default portfolio weighted by marketcap and to use the generated views to shift the weights of the assets. It will then track the recommended portfolio time and graphically show the user the expected return over each time period
